# Vector search

Traditional lexical search, based on term frequency models like BM25, is effective for many search applications. However, these techniques often require substantial time and expertise to fine-tune for capturing the meaning or relevance of search terms. To add semantic understanding to your search application, you can use machine learning embedding models. These models encode the meaning and context of text, images, and audio into vectors, enabling similarity search. OpenSearch supports this functionality through its k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) search capabilities. 

OpenSearch combines traditional search, analytics, and vector search into a single, unified solution. Its vector database capabilities simplify the development of artificial intelligence (AI) applications by reducing the effort required to manage and integrate AI-generated assets. You can bring your models, vectors, and metadata into OpenSearch to enable vector, lexical, and hybrid search and analytics, all with built-in performance and scalability.

## Using OpenSearch as a vector database

OpenSearch provides an integrated  vector database that can support AI systems by serving as a knowledge base. This benefits AI applications like generative AI and natural language search by providing a long-term memory of AI-generated outputs. These outputs can be used to enhance information retrieval and analytics, improve efficiency and stability, and give generative AI models a broader and deeper pool of data from which to draw more accurate responses to queries.
